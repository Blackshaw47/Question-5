# Question-5

Jobs - A list of jobs, each job can have a list of tasks with the progress percentage and
expected end date. Find the overall progress percentage (average progress of all tasks) for
each job. List them in order of expected end date and overall progress percent. For example,
if a job has two tasks, progress for one is 100%, the other is 50%. So overall job progress is
75%.
Please note you need to create random data with about 10 jobs with titles “Job1”, “Job2” and
so on. Then for each job create a random number of tasks, say between 10 - 20 tasks with
random progress percentages between 0 - 100.
Hint: Use an array with an array, can be array of objects
